# Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Networks (PyTorch)

This project implements a neural network using PyTorch to classify breast cancer based on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. The model is trained to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

## Features
- Uses PyTorch for deep learning implementation.
- Applies a fully connected neural network for classification.
- Trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
- Provides accuracy evaluation and visualization of loss trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, available from [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).

## Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib pandas numpy
